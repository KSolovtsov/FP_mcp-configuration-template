- Possible implementation approach

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Issue that pull request!

**Pull Request Process:**

1. Update the README.md or docs/ with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with notes on your changes

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Node.js 18+ (for npm packages)
- Slack workspace for testing
- Claude Code or MCP Inspector for testing

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/slack-mcp-server.git
cd slack-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Copy environment template
cp .env.dist .env

# Edit .env with your Slack tokens
# See docs/01-authentication-setup.md for how to get tokens

# Build the project
make build

# Run tests
make test
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Run with stdio transport
go run cmd/slack-mcp-server/main.go --transport stdio

# Run with SSE transport
go run cmd/slack-mcp-server/main.go --transport sse

# Run with MCP Inspector
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector go run cmd/slack-mcp-server/main.go --transport stdio
```

### Project Structure

```

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

**Examples:**

```
Add support for Enterprise Grid organizations

- Implement admin API methods
- Add Enterprise workspace detection
- Update documentation

Fixes #123
```

### Go Style Guide

Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines and use `gofmt`:

```bash
# Format all Go files
gofmt -s -w .

# Run linter
golangci-lint run
```

**Key Points:**

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors explicitly
- Use context for cancellation

### Documentation

- Update docs/ for user-facing changes
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Update API reference for new MCP tools
- Include examples for new features

**Documentation Structure:**

- `docs/README.md` - Documentation index
- `docs/01-authentication-setup.md` - Auth setup
- `docs/02-installation.md` - Installation guide
- `docs/03-configuration-and-usage.md` - Configuration
- `docs/Slack_API_Complete_Reference.md` - Complete API reference
- `docs/Slack_Admin_API_Complete_Guide.md` - Admin guide

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run specific test
go test -run TestFunctionName ./pkg/...
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
# Run integration tests (requires real Slack workspace)
INTEGRATION_TEST=true go test ./...
```

### Manual Testing

Use MCP Inspector for manual testing:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector go run cmd/slack-mcp-server/main.go --transport stdio
```

## Building and Releasing

### Build for All Platforms

```bash
# Build for current platform
make build

# Build for all platforms
make build-all

# Build Docker image
make docker-build
```

### Creating a Release

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To create a release:

1. Update version in relevant files
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create and push a git tag: `git tag v1.x.x && git push origin v1.x.x`
4. GitHub Actions will build and publish automatically
